Run main.py to update all the groovy scripts
Main will run the respective files associated to each form
These files will generate all the required groovy scripts and copy the constant (not generated) ones into the Final folder
Afterwards all these files are copied to the crf folder and the ExportResourceMappingConfig is generated
These will correspond to the final version of each file

In the future when required to do updated on the groovy scripts these should be done in the respective folder and then run main again to generate everything again
